# Phase 1 Group Project
This is our group project for phase 1 of the DigitalCrafts Fullstack Flex course.

This Dashboard website is meant to be your internet browser homepage.

Not only does it give you a silly dad quote using the Dadjoke API, it also utilizes the weather API to give you the weather based on any zip code you type search and you can type in multiple zips in consecutive searches.

We also have a link in our navigation bar to the New York Times API which displays the top 20 or so news stories from the NYT.

We also utilize the moment.js library to give you your local time. It will change on a refresh of the page.
